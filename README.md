## Functionnalities
A basic list of functionality the app has:
- User can register / login on the website.
- User can explore the market.
- User can look into a single card & buy or sell if he already has it in his collection.
- User can deposit or withdraw money (fake).
- User can see his own collection and his historic of transaction (bought and sold).
